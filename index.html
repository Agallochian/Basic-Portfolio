					<p>
						I am a graduate of UT-Austin class of 2015 with a B.A. in Geography and Anthropology.
						I spend most of my leisure time listening to metal music and playing a little Halo.
						I hope to travel well in my life, hopefully see places on each continent, and meet new people.
						Mountain-biking and hiking are personal goals of mine to engage in regularly.
						A dog to bring along with me on these adventures would be fantastic, I freaking love dogs.
